/**
 * The sidebar-tabs rule, the pure half: which sidebar tabs a player loses, and the edit to
 * Foundry's tab table that takes them away (or gives them back). No Foundry here;
 * scripts/houserules.js hands it the table and the user.
 *
 * Foundry 14's sidebar builds its tab buttons from `Sidebar.TABS` (`CONFIG.ui.sidebar.TABS`), a
 * record of tab id to descriptor, and leaves out the button of a descriptor marked `gmOnly` on a
 * player's client (Scenes is marked so by Foundry itself). With no button there is no way in: the
 * strip, open or collapsed, has nothing to click or right-click to pop out, and `changeTab` to the
 * tab throws, as it does for Scenes. The rule marks the tabs in HIDDEN so, and only those: a tab a
 * module adds (Dice So Nice's) stays, and a GM's client draws every tab as before.
